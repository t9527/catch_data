## Welcome to Catch Data Pages

#   Catch Data Based on UNIX or GNU/Linux OS   #

     It is a simple tutorial for catching data you need from experiments result based on Linux OS. As Linux OS might be not available for us, we simulate running Linux OS in Windows OS using Cygwin. Thank you very much.
     PS: UNIX or GNU/ Linux is powerful and popular in industry.




     Tips: script content depends on data you need to catch, if you need different data, let me know please. I will update script. Thank you.
 
     First of all, you should install Cygwin in your computer from [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/)
     Secondly, change attachment csh script's name from 'catch_data_csh' to 'catch_data.csh', (catch_data.csh is not access), and put it under the path which your project script will run, refer to capture below, please.
     Thirdly, run the script catch_data.csh using the command 'csh catch_date.csh', please.
     At last, you will get reports below. Pay attention: only catch.rpt.4 is the result, using the edit command 'vi' to open it. Selecting the data, copy and paste to Notepad or Excel. 
     BTW, you may need to install 'csh' Package via Cygwin Setup in order to run command 'csh catcah_data.csh'. Refer to capture below, please. Thank you very much.
