## Welcome to Catch Data

#   Catch Data Based on UNIX or GNU/Linux OS   #

     It is a simple tutorial for catching data you need from experiments result based on Linux OS. As Linux OS might be not available for us, we simulate running Linux OS in Windows OS using Cygwin. Thank you very much.
     PS: UNIX or GNU/ Linux is powerful and popular in industry.



### Step by Step


```markdown

#1 Install **Cygwin** in your computer from [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/).
#2 Download [catch_data.csh](https://github.com/t9527/catch_data/blob/master/catch_data.csh), and put it under the path which your project script will run.
#3 Run the script catch_data.csh using the command `csh catch_date.csh`, please.
#4 Get reports below. Pay attention: only catch.rpt.4 is the result, using the edit command 'vi' to open it. Selecting the data, copy and paste to Notepad or Excel.

- install 'csh' Package via Cygwin Setup in order to run command `csh catcah_data.csh`
