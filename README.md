## Welcome to Catch Data README

#   Catch Data Based on UNIX or GNU/Linux OS   #
  It is a simple tutorial for catching data you need from experiments result based on **Unix** or **GNU/Linux OS**. As Linux OS might be not available for us, we simulate running Linux OS on Windows OS using **Cygwin**.
  

### Step by Step
1. Install **[Cygwin and Setup](https://github.com/t9527/catch_data/blob/master/Catch_data_3.PNG)** on your computer from [Home of Cygwin Project](https://www.cygwin.com/). 
- install 'csh' Package via [Cygwin Setup](https://github.com/t9527/catch_data/blob/master/Catch_data_4.PNG) in order to run command `csh catcah_data.csh`
2. Download [catch_data.csh](https://github.com/t9527/catch_data/blob/master/catch_data.csh), and put it under the path which your project script will run [project catch data](https://github.com/t9527/catch_data/blob/master/Catch_data_0.PNG).
3. Run the script catch_data.csh using the command `csh catch_date.csh`, please.
4. Get [Reports](https://github.com/t9527/catch_data/blob/master/Catch_data_1.PNG). Pay attention: only catch.rpt.4 is report of data we need, using the edit command 'vi' to open this [Report](https://github.com/t9527/catch_data/blob/master/Catch_data_2.PNG). Selecting the data, copy and paste to Notepad or Excel. 
- As there are only two sample reports for writing catch data script, only two numbers shown in catch.rpt.4 for just demo.

```markdown
- UNIX or GNU/Linux OS are powerful and popular in industry.

```

### Support or Contact

Script content depends on data you want to catch, if you need different data, let me know please. I will update script. Thank you.
